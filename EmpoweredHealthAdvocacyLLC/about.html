                Empowered Health Advocacy was officially founded in 2022 but was founded in our hearts many years before. Over the past decade, we have spent countless hours caring for people in 'off-time' helping to advocate for them, educate them, and connect them with local providers that suit their needs. Since the COVID-19 pandemic ramped up in the United States, the outcry for help has been even greater. Americans are becoming more interested in a different approach to healthcare. More and more Americans are demanding more complete care from their providers; and even more Americans are seeking alternative options to our 'typical' medicine. Empowered Health Advocacy is striving to help bridge the gap between patients and their providers by providing them with options they may not have considered, reviewing their medical history and healthcare goals, and supporting them until they meet those goals.

                Our doula services meet the advocacy needs of pregnant women throughout the region by offering prenatal, birth, and postpartum support. Through their formal education while obtaining their nursing degrees, doula training, L&D nurse experience, and personal birth experiences, Nicki & Jessie have a wide range of resources, tools, and support techniques available to help you achieve the birth experience you are looking for.
