                            <span class="impact-phrase">The passion for bridging the gap...</span> between patients and care providers was sparked by a series of health events in Nicki's young adulthood, which gave her first-hand experience with frustrating connection gaps with her care providers. Her 12-years of experience nursing ranges from emergency rooms in Missouri & Texas, helicopter primary response, high-risk labor & delivery, maternal transport, and COVID-19 home visits. The pandemic has emphasized the need for health advocates everywhere, so while living in Union, Missouri with her husband and two teenage boys, Nicki is committed to being the health advocate her community needs.
